# Steps

Glad you made it here! You are only a few steps away from trying buddybuild with our demo app!

1. Open Terminal and run the Git Clone Command shown on dashboard.
2. Modify the README.md file and make a change.
3. Back in Terminal, run ```git add```
4. Next, run ```git commit -m "This is my first change"```
5. Lastly, run ```git push origin master```
6. Now, head back to https://dashboard.buddybuild.com, you should see a build in progress.

# What is 2048?

This is a derivative of the iOS version of the game 2048. If you are unfamiliar with this game, you can check it out [here](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048).

## Licence and Other

2048 for iOS is licenced under the MIT license.

If you find the source code somewhat useful, all I ask is to download it from the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/2048-and-more!/id848859070?ls=1&mt=8), so I know that *someone* has seen it. Relax: It is free; it does not have any ads or weird stuff; it does not send you push notifications to ask you to go back and play it.

You may also consider to [donate](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) to the maker of the original 2048 if you'd like, of course. (:
